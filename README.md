# Qualitative-Activity-Recognition

This project has been created for **Getting and Cleaning Data** course project from 'Data Science Specialization' on Coursera provided by 'Johns Hopkins University'. The goal is to predict the quality of performed activies based on the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The utilized dataset is the **Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset** presented in the following paper:

*Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.*
